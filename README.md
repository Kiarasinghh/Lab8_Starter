How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
Both graceful degredation and service workers allow the app to function even if there are network issues and ensure usability. Service workers allow offline access as shown in this lab by allowing multithreaded programming and stores responses from reqeusts to the internet in the cache allowing it to remember the call and get the response faster the next time the same call is made. Both allow the essential features of the app to be displayed if there are errors such as brower incompatability (graceful degradation) or offline access (service workers).
